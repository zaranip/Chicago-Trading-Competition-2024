## General Thoughts
This year's competition included a live market making simulation (Case 1) and a portfolio optimization case (Case 2) from April 12-13. This was the first time some of us had ever attempted to anything related to quantitative finance - and also the first time that UMass Amherst was invited to the competition in all 12 years of its running (hopefully not the last!).

The event and case studies were very carefully planned, and we enjoyed every minute of it. Huge kudos to the team behind the competition!

## Case 1: Market Making

### Strategies
Please refer to https://trungdang.netlify.app/blogs/uchicagotc_writeups.html for the math.

1. **Penny in, Penny out with Levels**: This strategy involves placing orders at the best bid and ask prices, with the aim of capturing the bid-ask spread. The bot continuously adjusts its orders based on predefined levels to optimize its position in the order book.
2. **ETF Arbitrage**: The bot monitors the prices of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their underlying assets. It identifies and exploits price discrepancies between the ETF and its components, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
3. **GUI Interface and Accessory Strategies**: The bot includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows us to monitor its performance and adjust settings in real-time. Additionally, the bot employs accessory strategies, such as placing bogus bids, to manipulate the market and gain an advantage over other participants. We suggest that future competitiors also employ this, but to make sure that you can do X11 port forwarding before the competition.
4. **Noise**: Because the price, margins, and bid / ask spreads are hard to predict, we added additional "noise" to make our models for fair price non-deterministic. We used random values several times in our code: volume of assets transacted, edge parameter value, and whether to buy or sell first (all else held equal).
5. **Safety Mechanism**: Stop trading if we are losing too much (included in the GUI).

The GUI allowed us to control fade (rate of selling / buying assets), edge (profit margin sensitivity), slack (max margin), and minimum margin. These can be found in our "params_gui.py" file. 

Our edge specifically uses a tanh function to adjust our margins and a logarithmic function to adjust the fades. For the fade, our logic is that since we are using penny in and penny out and holding onto a lot of positions for a long time, then our function should bring us back to 0 for the total position for each asset because we want are trades to be high in frequency. For an example, we want our trades to be like +10/-20/+10 instead of +100/-100. The more the volume of each asset grows, the more the function penalizes the asset and will bring us closer to 0. The sign of the current position therefore dictates if we want to buy or sell more stock.

Here is the edge representation:

Here is what the final GUI looked like and the _base_ tanh function that we used to adjust the edge.

We used three different ways of evaluating fair value:
1. Potential energy graph for interaction between a proton and electron - we found the distributions of prices given to us fit very closely with this model. We did end up implementing this model in predictions.py, and it worked with varying results. We used a kernel density estimation (KDE) function to help estimate the final prices.

</p>
<br>
2. Exponential moving average (EMA) <br>
3. Sliding window mean<br>
4. Last transacted price. We used this during our training rounds with great success. Unfortunately, the hitter bots (explained later) messed up these calculations.

### Challenges
During the development and deployment of the bot, we encountered a significant challenge posed by "hitter bots". These bots aggressively hit our orders, making it difficult for our market-making bot to function effectively. The hitter bots' actions disrupted our bot's ability to maintain its desired position in the order book and execute trades as intended.

To mitigate the impact of hitter bots, we implemented various countermeasures and refined our algorithms. However, the presence of these bots highlighted the importance of robust error handling, risk management, and continuous monitoring when operating in a highly competitive and fast-paced trading environment.

## Case 2: Portfolio Optimization

### Portfolio Optimization: Case 2

In this case study, we focus on the portfolio optimization process, specifically highlighting the passive-aggressive mean reversion strategy and the insights gained from exploratory data analysis (EDA).

#### Passive-Aggressive Mean Reversion Strategy

During the portfolio optimization phase, we implemented a passive-aggressive mean reversion strategy based on this paper (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-012-5281-z). This strategy aims to capitalize on the tendency of asset prices to revert to their long-term average over time. The strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Identification of Mean-Reverting Assets**: Through extensive analysis of historical price data, we identified assets that exhibited mean-reverting behavior. These assets were characterized by prices that tended to oscillate around a long-term average, deviating from it in the short term but eventually reverting back to the mean.

2. **K-Fold Cross Validation**: We used this validation method to test the volatility and general patterns of each strategy type (noted below). Here is an example of one graph that we generated, out of at least 30 such graphs. These graphs helped to solidify our trust in the PAMR model to outperform other strategies.

#### Other Implemented Strategies
We implemented 9 strategies (besides PAMR) to test on the training data. Related graphs and results of these experiments can be found in the case_2 -> testing_metrics folder.

#### Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the exploratory data analysis phase, we made a crucial observation that supported the implementation of the passive-aggressive mean reversion strategy. While analyzing historical price data, we noticed that certain assets exhibited strong mean-reverting characteristics.

The EDA process involved the following steps:

1. **Data Visualization**: Price charts, correlation matrices, scree plots.
<p align="center">
  <img src="media/correlation_matrix.png" width="600">
</p>

3. **Statistical Tests**: We performed statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, to assess the stationarity of the price series. Stationary series are more likely to exhibit mean reversion, as they have a constant mean and variance over time.

4. **Autocorrelation Analysis**: We examined the autocorrelation of the price series to determine the presence of mean reversion. Negative autocorrelation, particularly at longer lags, indicated a tendency for prices to revert to their mean.

The insights gained from the EDA process provided strong evidence of mean-reverting behavior in certain assets. This information was instrumental in the development and implementation of the passive-aggressive mean reversion strategy within our portfolio optimization framework.

<!-- Takeaways -->
## Takeaways
**Case 1:**
<ul>
  <li>Don't overtrain on the training platform! Be aware of the impact of hitter bots. Being more conservative would have panned out better for us rather than having alternating rounds of $400k profit / -$400k loss because of hitter bots.</li>
  <li>Take advantage of the risk-free asset and buy up as many as possible.</li>
</ul>
<br>

**Case 2:**
<ul>
  <li>In the end, we submitted the algorithm with the best Sharpe, the PAMR model. One future consideration would be to make dynamically changing Sharpe, as this was not something that we knew was possible ;(.</li>
</ul>
